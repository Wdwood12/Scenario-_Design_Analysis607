# Health Recommender System (HRS): Scenario Design Analysis

This repository contains a scenario design analysis for a Health Recommender System (HRS) for a data science course on recommender systems.

## Project Overview

We examine how recommender system logic is used by customized health platforms like Fitbit and MyFitnessPal to assist users in achieving their health objectives. Using a paradigm known as Scenario Design, the study takes corporate objectives and user demands into account.

### Key Topics:

Scenario design from the viewpoints of the organization and its users

Reverse engineering HRS features, such as context-aware and content-based filtering

Suggestions for enhancing ethical design, customisation, and transparency

A graphic representation of scholarly research on HRS development
